# Edison Community Ruler 📜

A community-driven custom format for EDOPro, aiming to revive the strategic depth of the original Edison format with controlled integration of modern cards.

## 🎯 What is the Project About?

*   **Revive Edison Format:** Recreate the balanced and strategic gameplay of the original April 2010 Edison format.
*   **Controlled Modernization:** Introduce modern cards (up to 2013, or later with caution) while avoiding power creep.
*   **Community Empowerment:** Enable players to vote on allowed cards, bans, and rule changes.

## 🛠️ How Does It Work?

### ✅ Allowed Mechanics:

*   **Synchro:** The central mechanic of the original Edison format.
*   **Fusion:** Includes classic Fusion monsters like Gladiator Beast fusions, as well as more modern, balanced options.

### ❌ Excluded Mechanics:

*   XYZ
*   Pendulum
*   Link
*   Any mechanics introduced after 2010

### 🃏 Allowed Cards:

*   **Initial Phase:** Only cards released up to January 1, 2013, are permitted.
*   **Advanced Phase:** Cards released after 2013 (2014-2023) can be considered if they meet specific criteria:
    *   Must not disrupt the format's balance.
    *   Should empower weaker archetypes or increase overall diversity.

### 🗳️ Community Voting System:

*   **Dynamic Banlist:** The community votes on which cards should be banned or limited.
*   **New Card Proposals:** Players can suggest the addition of modern cards, which are then tested in trial duels before a final decision is made.

### ⚙️ Key Rules:

*   **No Powercreep:** Cards with overly fast effects or that enable one-card combos (e.g., generic searchers) are prohibited.
*   **Interaction-First:** Priority is given to cards that require resource management and strategic thinking (e.g., Level 4 monsters with moderate effects).

## ⚔️ Practical Example

*   **Player A:** Plays a Six Samurai deck with modern support cards (up to 2013) to quickly summon Synchros like Legendary Six Samurai - Shi En.
*   **Player B:** Plays an updated Gladiator Beast deck, using classic Fusions like Heraklinos alongside support cards from 2012 to improve consistency.
*   **Result:** Tactical duels that emphasize resource management and strategic interruptions to determine the winner.
